\section*{Installation}

CausalInference can be installed using \texttt{pip}, and will run provided the necessary dependencies are in place. On Ubuntu systems, the following commands should take care of all the essential steps if you are starting from scratch:
\begin{verbatim}
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-numpy python-scipy
  $ sudo pip install causalinference
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Minimal Example}

\begin{verbatim}
  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from causalinference import *
  >>> Y = np.random.rand(1000)
  >>> D = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
  >>> X = np.random.rand(1000, 3)
  >>> causal = CausalModel(Y, D, X)
\end{verbatim}
